CVAT Relationship Annotation Tool
https://via.placeholder.com/150 (Placeholder for your project logo)

A powerful desktop application that automates relationship annotation for CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) XML files. This tool helps accelerate annotation workflows by automatically generating relationship points based on predefined rules and enables custom relationship creation.

Features âœ¨
â€‹â€‹Automated Relationship Generationâ€‹â€‹: Auto-generate relationships based on object categories and predefined rules
â€‹â€‹Custom Relationship Creationâ€‹â€‹: Define custom relationships between objects with an intuitive UI
â€‹â€‹Rule Managementâ€‹â€‹: Create and manage rules for automatic relationship generation
â€‹â€‹Label Configurationâ€‹â€‹: Import label sets from Excel/CSV files
â€‹â€‹Auto-Backupâ€‹â€‹: Automatic backup of original XML files before processing
â€‹â€‹Batch Processingâ€‹â€‹: Process multiple XML files efficiently

Getting Started ðŸš€
Basic Workflow
Open the application
Select an input CVAT XML file
Optionally create custom relationships using the Custom Relationship mode
Click "Execute Auto Annotation" to process the file
Review the output XML file with generated relationships
Using Custom Relationship Mode
Select "Custom Relationship" from the menu
Enter the subject category or ID
Select the object category or ID
Choose a predicate
Click "Add to List"
Repeat as needed, then click "Confirm"
Managing Rules
Click "Manage Rules"
